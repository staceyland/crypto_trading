Brief analysis of my cryptocurrency trading strategy

I just started a new cryptocurrency trading plan over the summer. This is a moving average strategy that I started over the summer to collect small gains in the market. Each trade is a long and I won't close the trade (sell) until I have reached at least 1% profitability. These are the trades I used to test the strategy. The data set I have uploaded are the the crypto trades I took since June.

Which trades were most profitable? How long did I stay in a trade? Which markets were the best to trade? I analyze this in this exercise.

Overall this exercise has given me good insights on my new trading plan. I can consider adding more DOGE trades to increase my profitability and decrease how long I have to hold a trade. Most of my trades are ETH and they tend to be the least profitable. I hold ADA trades the longest. Now I can make some changes and re-evaluate my trading strategy. Happy trading!!
